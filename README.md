## Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of ChatGPT-4 and Grammarly in the preparation of this project. The tools played a significant role in:

- Providing insights and suggestions for improving the structure and functionality of the code.
- Generating concise and accurate summaries of complex texts to enhance understanding and clarity.

While ChatGPT-4 contributed significantly to streamlining the development process and improving the quality of outputs, all results were rigorously reviewed, tested, and refined to ensure their accuracy, relevance, and alignment with project objectives.

## Introduction


## Getting started 
1. Create a Virtual Environment

   Run the following command to create your virtual environment
